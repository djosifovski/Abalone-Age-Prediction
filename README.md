# Abalone Age Prediction

## Motivation
Abalones are sea snails that are very nutritious and expensive delicacy for their unique taste. Thus, they are in high demand, especially in Asia. This has created a multibillion dollar export industry. There is a positive correlation between the economic value and age of abalone. Thus, determining the age of abalone is an important task because it affects revenue. The traditional approach is time-consuming, and different approaches are needed to speed up the process. The motivation for this project is to address that by determining the age of abalone from physical measurements with machine learning models.

## Methodology
This is a regression type of problem in which a subset of learning algorithms were trained from scikit-learn (k-nearest neighbors, SVR, and random forest), and XGBoost and TabNet regressors. As a single number evaluation metric $R^2$ is used.

## Results
The most optimal model is Support Vector Regressor where the evaluation metric for the test data set is $R^2=0.648345$.

## Technologies
Technologies that are used in this project are: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TabNet, Jupyter Notebook.
